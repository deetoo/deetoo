### I'm Doug, and I'm not a Coder.

Now that we have that out of the way, you'll find poorly written code here, but it will work (well, it worked whe nI commited it.) You may find some value in some of the projects I created here, if so I'm glad to have helped out, evern if only a bit.

Some things you may find interesting in my repos:
- [![RadioNerd](https://github.com/deetoo/RadioNerd)] - This was my project to scrape iHeartRadio local stations, and create tables of which songs were most recently played, and how often those songs are played.
- [![GrafanaSystemLoginFailures](https://github.com/deetoo/GrafanaSystemLoginFailures)] - This is my project that uses Grafana to graph how often I have skidz attempt to bruteforce my Linux server.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: Becoming better at my job, there is a LOT to learn.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: More about Azure Container Instances, and Azure Copntainer Regiuustry than I ever cared to know about.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: I've been a lifelong Angler, and just started kayak fishing. It's incredibly relaxing and would definitely recommend.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I used to be a Welder... I have slid down the emergency exit chute of a commercial jet... My spirit animal is the Turtle.
